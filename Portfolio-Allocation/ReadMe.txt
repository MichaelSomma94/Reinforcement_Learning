this is a training script to perform dynamic portfolio alllocation
It's based on:

-  YahooFinance to fetch stock data
- FinRL library for Feautre engineering
-  Stable Baseline a library with PyTorch-based DRL implementations
-  PyFolio for backtesting the investment strategy

You can choose the period you want to train the agent on and the period you want your agent to trade in order to validate it. 

A Script for active trading with an Online Brooker API is coming soon.

Enjoy Deep RL!
